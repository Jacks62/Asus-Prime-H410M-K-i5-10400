**So finally we can post this baby after weeks of trying to get everything to work. Running Sequoia 15.0**

Okay lets go over the drill:

i5-10400
UHD 630 (This is what is doing all the work)
16gb 3200MHz Memory (but sadly down clocked to 2666MHz by this stupid mobo)
ALC 897 using layout 99
OC 1.0.1
TL-WN823N (this is a usb adapter I use because my intel card has short antennas)
Intel AC 7260(WIFI+BT PCIE)

**And of course the items that do not work**

My audio does not auto switch between front panel jack and rear audio jack
Intel AC 7260(WIFI+BT PCIE)
AirDrop (Big surprise)
